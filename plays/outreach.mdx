## Outreach Strategy

Strategies instruct your AI rep on how to write email sequences. They contain special instructions for initial emails and each followup email, a specific followup cadence, and training examples. **Select from our template library or create your own.**

Example Use Case:
- Keep the initial email very brief, and use followups to add more context.

## Special Writing Instructions

Give specific instructions to your AI sales rep when writing certain types of emails. This can be a highly effective way to modify the writing output.

Example Use Cases:
- "Always use Australian spelling."
- "Never promise specific timelines for our client projects."

## Write Test Emails

Use the `Write Test Email` button to generate a sample email -- or entire sequence -- of what outreach to a prospect may look like.

Note: **Unsaved changes to the Play will not reflect in Test Emails until published**
