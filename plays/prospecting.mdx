### Company + Lead Criteria

Search for companies based on fixed criteria, like industries, location, and size.

Use the `+ Fields` button to add new lead search criteria.

As you modify these parameters, check the estimated company count to make sure your criteria is not too specific to yield results.

### Qualifiers

Qualifiers are true or false statements that Playmaker will answer about your prospect company by searching the web.

Example Use Cases:
- "This company sells to businesses" 
- "This company has a careers page on their website"

### Target Persona

Target personas help your AI rep narrow down your leads to ensure they're a fit specific for your product.

Example Use Cases:
- Filter leads to just those who would have purchasing power for my product.
- Filter leads to just those who might be direct users of my product.
