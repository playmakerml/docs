## Train your AI Prospecting

Navigate to **Approvals -> Leads**

Train your rep with the `approve` and `reject` buttons. This will help instruct future results. 

<Warning>
If the results are far from your desired output, you may need to revisit the Play's prospecting parameters.
</Warning>

## Train your AI Writing

Navigate to **Approvals -> Emails**

Here you can interact with the emails your AI sales rep has written. You can edit them yourself, use them to build your training library, or send them once ready.

### Snippets

Highlight a phrase in the email, and click `Bad` or `Good` to add this phrase to your training library. 

Example Use Cases:
- Save good examples to help the writer mimic good behavior in the future
- Save bad examples to instruct the writer to avoid certain phrasing

### Subject Lines

Hover over the subject line -> click the `thumbs up` or `thumbs down` to add it to your training library.

Similar to a snippet, this will instruct the writer to mimic or avoid behavior in the future.

### Email Examples

Lastly, you can add entire emails to your training library with the `More like this` button.

<Tip>
We recommend **about 5 example emails**. Adding too many example emails can result in the writer replicating examples too closely, without enough variety.

## Managing Your Training Library

As you save positive and negative examples in the **Approvals** page, these will save to the **Training** page. Here, you can edit or delete those saved examples.
