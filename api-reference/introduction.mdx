## Authentication

All API endpoints are authenticated using Bearer tokens generated in your Playmaker account (Settings -> API Keys).

```json
Authorization: Bearer {token}
```

## Rate Limits

To ensure optimal performance and availability, our API enforces rate limits on requests. These limits are designed to provide a consistent experience for all users.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="POST Endpoints" icon="upload">
    Up to 25 requests per 60 seconds
  </Card>

  <Card title="GET Endpoints" icon="download">
    Up to 5 requests per 60 seconds.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Handling Rate Limits

If you exceed the rate limit, the API responds with a 429 Too Many Requests status code. The response includes a Retry-After header indicating the time to wait before retrying.

```json
{
  "code":"ERROR_CODE_TOO_MANY_REQUESTS",
  "message":"Rate limit exceeded",
  "status":"error"
  }
```

### Best Practices to Avoid Throttling

* Implement exponential backoff for retries.

* Use paginated requests when fetching large datasets.

* Cache responses where appropriate to reduce redundant requests.
